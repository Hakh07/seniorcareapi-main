# SeniorCare â€“ Accessibility-First Elderly Care Assistant  

This repository contains my final year dissertation project: **SeniorCare**, an accessibility-first Android app with a caregiver admin panel, powered by a Node.js REST API and a MySQL database deployed on Railway.  

The goal of SeniorCare is to help seniors manage **appointments, medications, social events, and emergency contacts** through a simple, accessible UI, while caregivers can administer doctors and services via a secure admin panel.
